## STL Vector Container Implementation

[Standard Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) vector is a container class, that can be used like a dynamic array. The elements of a [vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) are stored in contiguous memory.

This project is a re - implementation of the standard STL vector library of C++. It's designed to be exception safe, effcient and memory safe.
